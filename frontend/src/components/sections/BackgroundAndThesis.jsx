          At PEV, we believe entrepreneurship is a key driver for development.
          Specifically, high-growth, high-potential ventures working to develop
          important innovations and disruptive new business models are uniquely
          able to capture sustainable economic growth.

          These ventures builds strong communities, representing a significant
          source of employment and a reliable income stream for future
          generations. The entrepreneurs PEV exists to support contribute up to
          two-thirds of national GDP and provide the foundation for a stable
          middle class.
